# <p align="center">ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION</p>

### <p align="right">-Team TechnoVision</p>

For the Institute Technical Summer Project-2018, our team intends to build an Attendance System to record the attendance of all the students present that day who have registered for the course. It would consist of a bot, a database to store all relevant details, an app for students to check their attendance and also another app for the professor to control the bot via bluetooth

In order to tackle the loopholes in the current methods of manual attendance and introduce tech in various schools and colleges, we came up with this idea to make a bot that could use face recognition to mark the attendance of students while they are sitting for the lecture. The app for the students would be such that they get to check their attendance which would be updated in our database immediately when the bot records their attendance.

We would like to start for a small classroom with not many students to test this idea of ours.
